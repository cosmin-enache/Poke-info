Wrap a 'PokemonDataProvider' context around <App />, with the context created separately,
and a usePokemonData() hook, which returns useful functions such as read data and set data

useEffect with axios.get to fetch pokemon data when the app loads, make sure to pass an
empty array as a second argument so the data only gets fetched on load and on unmount only

Add MUI skeletons so when the app loads it loads in a fashionable manner
