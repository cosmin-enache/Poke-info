- Had to figure out a way to abstract the data layer from the app component,
therefore, I created a PokemonDataProvider, which uses a custom hook to fetch
data from the pokeApi, then stores it in PokemonDataContext.
usePokemonData is another hook used to grab the data from PokemonDataContext in
a clean manner.
